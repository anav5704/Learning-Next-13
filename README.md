![hero page](https://github.com/anav5704/promptopia-next-13/blob/main/docs/hero.png)
This is one of the first full-stack Next JS websites I have made. It's pretty simple, login and then perform CRUD operations on "AI Pronpts". This project also utilizes Next JS server actions, which were still experimental back when I made this.

## Technologies Used
- Next JS 13
- TailwindCSS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Next Auth
- Bcrypt
